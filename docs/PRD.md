# StartClaw — Product Requirements Document

## One-Liner
Deploy your personal AI assistant in 60 seconds. No servers, no terminal, no BS.

## Problem
OpenClaw is powerful but setup takes 1-4 hours:
- Buy VPS
- SSH in
- Install Node.js
- Clone repo
- Configure Docker
- Create Telegram bot
- Set API keys
- Manage SSL
- Keep it running 24/7

**90% of interested users give up.**

## Solution
StartClaw handles everything:
1. User signs up
2. Picks AI provider (or uses free tier)
3. Creates Telegram bot (guided)
4. Pastes token
5. We provision container + connect + go live
6. **Under 60 seconds**

## Target Users

1. **Non-technical people** who saw OpenClaw on Twitter
2. **Developers** who don't want to manage infra
3. **Small teams** wanting shared AI assistant
4. **India market** (₹199/mo vs $24/mo competitors)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| OpenClaw changes breaking | Pin versions, test before update |
| API provider rate limits | Fallback chain (Groq → Gemini → OpenRouter) |
| User data breach | Encryption at rest, minimal access |
| GCP credits run out | Profitable before credits expire (6 users = break-even) |
